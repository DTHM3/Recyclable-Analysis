# SVT Recyclable Analysis
A project for CS-4774 Machine Learning at UVA that leverages:
- Random Forrest Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Artificial Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network
to classify recyclables based on the classes of:
- Soda Can
- Crushed Soda Can
- Plastic Bottle
- Glass Bottle
- Boxes

## Dataset
It had the aforementioned 5 classes of reclyables from Portland State University at the following link.

## About Experience
The experience allowed for creation of a machine learning project from the ground up with two group members that involved detailed planning and production of various machine learning tactics to create a model. We chose to classify recyclables as we saw ita importance to UVA and Virginia as a whole. This project was done as part of ML4VA as part of Rich Nguyen's class.
